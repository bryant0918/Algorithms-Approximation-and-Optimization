Problem 1 (5 points):
Score += 5

Problem 2 (5 points):
Your audio files are the right pitch, but they are half the lenght of the original. The first sound you make should be identical to tada.wav, the second should sound the same but be a bit louder.
Score += 3

Problem 3 (5 points):
Score += 5

Problem 4 (5 points):
The first sound file should be 3 seconds long.
Score += 4

Problem 5 (5 points):
Score += 5

Problem 6 (10 points):
Print the times of your dft and fft, and scipy's fft.
Score += 5

Code Quality (5 points):
Add some more comments to your code.
Score += 2

Problem 2.1 (5 points):
You need to display both the circular convolution of tada and the white noise, as well as the appended noise. Also, the whitenoise should go for 2 seconds, not 4. I.e. rate*4 (I know the .pdf is confusing in this manner)
Score += 3

Problem 2.2 (10 points):
The original two soundwaves were not embedded (they should be), also your convolved sounds don't sound quite correct. There are some ticks in there that shouldn't be there. 
Score += 7

Problem 2.3 (5 points):
You didn't embed the balloon sound
Score += 4

Problem 2.4 (10 points):
Score += 10

Problem 2.5 (5 points):
Score += 5

Problem 2.6 (10 points):
Incomplete
Score += 0

Code Quality (5 points):
You need to add code comments

Problem 2.1 (5 points):
Score += 5

Problem 2.2 (10 points):
There is a weird tick in both of your linear convolves, additionally scipy's implementation sounds different because you convolved the soundwave objects instead of the samples. They should sound the same. 
Score += 8

Problem 2.3 (5 points):
See above comment, your linear convolved noise doesn't sound quite right because you convolved the soundwave objects. 
Score += 4

Problem 2.4 (10 points):
Score += 10

Problem 2.5 (5 points):
Score += 5
